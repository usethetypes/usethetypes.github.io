title: Frameworks
layout: article

I hope eventually to cover a diverse range of programming topics in Haskell. To start with, I'm going to concentrate on the development of web applications. The frameworks and packages I expect to cover early on will include:

* [Snap][snap-framework]
* [Aeson][aeson-hackage]

I also expect to talk about integrating with services and platforms such as:

* [Heroku][heroku]
* [Amazon Web Services][aws]

[aeson-hackage]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson
[aws]: https://aws.amazon.com/
[heroku]: https://heroku.com/
[snap-framework]: http://snapframework.com/
